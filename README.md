# gulp-github

I was looking for a way to bring the content resulting from my Bitbucket hosted code to GitHub in order to use TravisCI and AppVeyor.

Then I found the great job [node-deploy-essentials](https://github.com/codeclou/node-deploy-essentials). In order to support my needs (automate tasks, automatic tag control) I modifiedi, changed and created a plugin for Gulp.

Apparently this functional, I'll test and start using, make a usage documentation and then make it available in the list of Gulp plugins.
